Status Indicator: Below the dropdowns, create a dynamic text box. Design it to show urgency-driven messages. For example:

Before selection: "Please select your desired location to check for open slots."

After selection (if available): A green box with the message: "Congratulations! Only 2 slots left in this area! Apply now to claim yours."

After selection (if unavailable): A red box with the message: "We're sorry, this area is currently fully allocated. Please check a nearby location or contact us for future openings."
